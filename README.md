# FTOT-SCR 

Freight and Fuel Transportation Optimization Tool - Supply Chain Resilience 

## Description
FTOT is a flexible scenario-testing tool that optimizes the transportation of materials for future energy and freight scenarios.  FTOT models and tracks commodity-specific information and can take into account conversion  of raw materials to products (e.g., crude oil to jet fuel and diesel) and the fulfillment of downstream demand. FTOT was developed at the US Dept. of Transportation's Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.

## Installation 
To install, clone this repository to a directory `C:\FTOT-SCR`. Follow instructions from the main FTOT-Public repository to install supporting Python packages.
